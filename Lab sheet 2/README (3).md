# System Startup & Process Simulation (ENCS351 – Operating Systems Lab Sheet 2)

This repository contains the solution for **Lab Assignment 2** of ENCS351 Operating Systems.  
The goal is to simulate a simple **system startup**, **process creation**, **execution**, and **shutdown** using Python multiprocessing and logging.

LAB_SHEETS/
 ├─ Lab_Sheet_2/
 │   ├─ system_startup_simulation.py

```

## Objectives

- Understand simulated **system booting**
- Create and manage processes using **multiprocessing**
- Log lifecycle events (start/end) with timestamps
- Generate `process_log.txt` showing system-like process behavior

---

## Concepts Used

- multiprocessing.Process  
- logging (timestamps + processName)  
- time.sleep() (dummy system workload)
